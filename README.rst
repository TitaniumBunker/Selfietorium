Selfietorium
=======================

Dave wanted a photo booth at his wedding, and so he built one.  

This is the code that runs on the Raspberry pi - and should be potentially 
runnable on non-rpi hardware - the only RPI specific code is realting to the 
GPIO.  

This code has been tested on Ubuntu, using a laptop, and seems to work fine.
